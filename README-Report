I have practiced and worked with CSS and layouts. Initially the problems appeared difficult for me.
After working through a few problems, I found it interesting and at less challanging than before.

Key Learnings

    Flexibility of CSS: CSS offers greater flexibility.
    Browser Compatibility: I encountered issues related to cross-browser compatibility. Same page appears differently in different browsers.
    Debugging Techniques: Using browser developer tools I debugged a few errors.

Challenges Faced

    Understanding Flex and Grid: At first, I struggled with it.
    Responsive Design Complexities: The assignment requirements are often not described properly and it took a long time to understand them.
